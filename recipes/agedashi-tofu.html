        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What is your favorite appetizer when you dine at a Japanese restaurant? </p>
        <p>Many JOC readers told me that they love ordering Agedashi Tofu (揚げ出し豆腐). 
            Served in a sweet-savory broth, these lightly fried crispy tofu have an airy crunch 
            and melt-in-your-mouth texture. 
            So good that you wish you could eat the entire bowl yourself!
        </p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medium-firm Todu</li>
            <li>Potato starch</li>
            <li>Cookiling Oil</li>
            <li>Tsuyu Sauce</li>
            <li>Garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain the tofu for 15 minutes.
                 Don’t drain too long if you want 
                 the soft velvety texture on the inside.
                </li>
            <li> make tsuyu sauce by combining dashi, 
                mirin, and soy sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Cut the tofu block into 6 pieces and 
                coat them with potato starch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deep fry the tofu for 2 minutes until
                lightly browned and drain the excess oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the tofu in a bowl and pour the tsuyu
                sauce. Garnish the tofu with grated daikon,
                chopped green onion, grated ginger, and bonito flakes.
            </li>
        </ol>
